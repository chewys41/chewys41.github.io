<h3 class="facts">Fun Facts about me</h3>
<p>-Basketball and Football are my favorite sports to watch since I played both growning up. My favorite teams are the Dallas Cowboys and the Dallas Mavericks. I'm not a die hard fan where I watch every game and paint my face but I will watch when I can.</p>
<p>-I have many things on my bucket list but the one that sticks out the most is to be my own boss so I can make it easier to complete the rest of my bucket list.</p>
<p>-One accomplishment that I'm proud of is working my butt off in sports growing up and getting All State in Basketball, Football, and track. </p>
