            <p class="textSize">My name is Matt Schmitt and I was born and raised in Montana. I grew up in Fairfield which is a small town
                of about 800 people. Throughout middle school and high school I was very competitive in basketball,
                football and track and when I wasnâ€™t playing sports I was working for a construction company to help pay
                for college. I attended the University of Montana pursuing a degree in athletic training. After 2 years I
                decided to work full time and have had various jobs from construction to being a glacier guide in Alaska. I
                now work for Montana Rail Link in the track maintenance department which I have been doing for 5 years now.
                I have been interested in web development for a while and finally found a part time class in Bozeman
                Montana and hope it can lead to a new career someday. I believe I have a good set of skills that would make
                me a good fit for any company. </p>
